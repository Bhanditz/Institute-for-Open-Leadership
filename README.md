# Institute for Open Leadership

The Institute for Open Leadership (http://openpolicynetwork.org/iol/) is the first major initiative of the Open Policy Network. The Institute is a training program to identify and cultivate new leaders in open education, science, public policy, and other fields on the values and implementation of openness in licensing, policies, and practices. The rationale for the Institute is to educate and empower potential open advocates within existing institutional structures in order to expand and promote the values and practices of the idea the publicly funded resources should be openly licensed. It is important that the Institute help fellows move from theory to reality: A major component of the program requires fellows to develop, refine, and implement a capstone open policy project within their home institution. Creative Commons and the open community will provide mentorship and guidance throughout this process. Weâ€™ve secured a limited amount of funding for the Institute from the Hewlett Foundation and Open Society Foundations.
